Weather & Energy Usage Analysis
📊 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and energy consumption across multiple cities. 
The datasets were synthetically generated using Python's random module to simulate realistic daily records of weather and energy usage.

The goal is to analyze patterns such as:

Temperature effects on energy use

Rainy vs non-rainy day consumption

City-level comparisons

Seasonal trends and rolling averages

🧰 Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

✅ Completed Tasks
Beginner Level
Loaded and cleaned datasets

Calculated average daily temperatures

Identified hottest and coldest days per city

Counted rainy days per city

Merged datasets on common columns

Intermediate Level
Computed total energy usage by type (residential, commercial, industrial)

Analyzed energy usage on rainy vs non-rainy days

Calculated correlation between temperature and residential energy use

Generated 7-day rolling averages

Grouped energy usage by city and month

Compared weekday vs weekend energy consumption

Found cities with the most fluctuation in wind speed

📁 Data Sources
Two CSV files:

weather_data.csv – containing columns like city, date, temperature_max, temperature_min, precipitation_mm, wind_speed_kmph, etc.

energy_usage.csv – with fields like city, date, residential_usage_kwh, commercial_usage_kwh, industrial_usage_kwh, etc.

🔹 Both datasets were generated manually using Python's random module to simulate 1500+ records.
